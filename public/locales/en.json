To do this you should first run different configurations with the same backtest settings - specifically with the same currency pair and time period. Only after your are confident that your configuration leads to a profit, you should adjust your backtesting time period to see how your strategies perform in a different market state.<br>Finally you can try chaning the currency pair to see how your strategies perform on other pairs. But we recommend to find separate strategy configurations for high-volume coins such as BTC or ETH, which behave completely different than low-volume coins (TRX, OMG,...). This is due to more liquidity in the order book. Even for USD and BTC base pairs you should use and optimize different strategy configurations.",
